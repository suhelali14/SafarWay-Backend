/**
 * Destinations Implementation Changes
 * 
 * Problem:
 * The application was trying to use a direct 'destination' field on the TourPackage model,
 * but the Prisma schema defines destinations as a many-to-many relation.
 * This was causing errors when creating or updating packages.
 * 
 * Changes Made:
 * 
 * 1. Backend Changes:
 *    - Added the destination field to the Prisma schema to make it compatible with existing code
 *    - Updated createPackage function to handle the destination field and the destinations relation:
 *      - Now it sets both the direct destination field and establishes the destinations relation
 *      - First checks if a destination with that name exists
 *      - If it exists, connects to it
 *      - If not, creates a new destination and connects to it
 *    - Updated updatePackage function to properly set both the destination field and destinations relation
 *    - Added destinations relation inclusion in getPackageById and getPackages
 *    - Added backward compatibility by returning first destination's name as 'destination' field
 * 
 * 2. Frontend Changes:
 *    - Updated Package interface to include destinations as a relation
 *    - Kept destination field for backward compatibility
 *    - Modified form handling to ensure both new and old code works
 * 
 * The key fix was to include both approaches:
 * 
 * In the Prisma schema:
 * ```
 * model TourPackage {
 *   // ... other fields
 *   destination       String?   // Added for backward compatibility with existing API
 *   destinations      Destination[]
 *   // ... other fields
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * In createPackage and updatePackage:
 * ```
 * // Include both destination field and destinations relation
 * destination: destination || null, // Direct field for backward compatibility
 * destinations: destination ? {
 *   connect: destinationsData
 * } : undefined,
 * ```
 * 
 * This ensures we're both satisfying the database schema and maintaining backward compatibility.
