# SafarWay API Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines the performance optimization strategies implemented to improve API response times, particularly for the `/api/customers/packages` endpoint.

## Problem

Slow API response times were observed, especially for package searches with destination filters:
- Initial query: `GET /api/customers/packages?page=1&limit=12&status=PUBLISHED&destination=London` - 1207.08ms

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Database Optimizations

#### Added Database Indexes
```prisma
model TourPackage {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Indexes for optimized queries
  @@index([status])
  @@index([tourType])
  @@index([pricePerPerson])
  @@index([agencyId])
  @@index([createdAt])
  @@index([destination])
}
```

#### SQL Optimizations
- Added GIN indexes for text search using PostgreSQL's `pg_trgm` extension
- Created composite index for commonly combined search parameters

### 2. Query Optimizations

- **Parallel Queries**: Used `Promise.all` to run multiple database queries in parallel
- **Optimized Destination Search**: First check exact matches in the `destination` field, then fallback to more complex relational queries
- **Field Selection**: Only request the fields actually needed for the response
- **Performance Measurement**: Added detailed timing metrics to identify bottlenecks

### 3. Cache Improvements

- **Enhanced Redis Configuration**: 
  - Improved connection reliability with exponential backoff retry strategy
  - Added connection pooling optimizations
  - Better error handling to fall back to memory cache

- **Optimized Cache Strategy**:
  - Increased cache TTLs for common searches
  - Added specific cache keys for destination and tour type searches
  - Implemented LRU-like memory cache eviction strategy
  - Added performance metrics for cache operations

- **Response Compression**:
  - Enhanced compression settings for different content types
  - Skip compression for small responses and already-cached content

## Expected Results

These optimizations should significantly improve API response times:

| Endpoint | Before | After (Expected) |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Destination Search | 1200ms | 300-400ms (initial), <100ms (cached) |
| General Package List | 800ms | 200-300ms (initial), <100ms (cached) |
| Package Details | 500ms | 150-200ms (initial), <50ms (cached) |

## Monitoring and Future Improvements

- Monitor performance metrics in the logs
- Consider implementing ElasticSearch for more complex text search scenarios
- Evaluate PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities for improved text search
- Consider database read replicas to scale query performance

## Running the Migrations

To apply the database optimizations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Redis Configuration

Ensure Redis is properly configured in your environment:

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-server:6379
REDIS_DB=0
```

If Redis is not available, the system will automatically fall back to in-memory caching.
